A programme of works will be issued with the Invitation to Tender to shortlisted suppliers. It is likely that there will be a requirement for monitoring presence for much of the duration of the Main Contract scope (To September 2027). About the buyer's selection process: Respondents to this opportunity should be advised that shortlisted applicants will be invited to tender through an external ERP system. The exact scoring criteria are currently being developed by BBVS, and shortlisted suppliers will be invited to register for the ERP system in due course. What is clear at this stage is that tenders will be scored competitively across a range of criteria, such as, but not limited to: Commercial, Programme, Methodology, HSEQ, Capability and Capacity.  About the buyer: In 2018, Balfour Beatty, VINCI and Systra (BBVS) created a strategic alliance to deliver major infrastructure projects for HS2, in particular the Terminus at Old Oak Common.</td>\n",

       "8  NEPO used an open tender procedure for the procurement of this framework agreement. This involved the publication of selection and award criteria in order to meet the requirements of contracting authorities that would be using the framework agreement and these were evaluated in accordance with the award criteria contained within the invitation to tender documents. The most economically advantageous tenderer was awarded to the framework agreement which will be made available for use by all contracting authorities throughout the North East Region (as defined by the Public Contracts Regulations 2015) including but not limited to government departments and their agencies, non-departmental public bodies, central government, NHS bodies, local authorities, emergency services, coastguard emergency services, educational establishments, registered social landlords and registered charities who have a need to purchase the above services. The framework agreement will be awarded to a ranked list of up to a maximum of two (2) suppliers for each lot with the 1st ranked being designated the primary supplier and the 2nd ranked the contingency supplier. Contracting authorities will then be able to call-off by way of direct award to the primary supplier. If the primary supplier notifies NEPO that it is no longer able to supply under the framework agreement or if they fail to meet the delivery and performance requirements of the framework agreement, then contracting authorities will be able to direct award to the contingency supplier.

A programme of works will be issued with the Invitation to Tender to shortlisted suppliers. It is likely that there will be a requirement for monitoring presence for much of the duration of the Main Contract scope (To September 2027). About the buyer's selection process: Respondents to this opportunity should be advised that shortlisted applicants will be invited to tender through an external ERP system. The exact scoring criteria are currently being developed by BBVS, and shortlisted suppliers will be invited to register for the ERP system in due course. What is clear at this stage is that tenders will be scored competitively across a range of criteria, such as, but not limited to: Commercial, Programme, Methodology, HSEQ, Capability and Capacity.  About the buyer: In 2018, Balfour Beatty, VINCI and Systra (BBVS) created a strategic alliance to deliver major infrastructure projects for HS2, in particular the Terminus at Old Oak Common.   \n",
